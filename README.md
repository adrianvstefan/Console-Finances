# Console-Finances

Creating code for analysing the financial records of a company

## Description 

With a list of financial data showing the profit/losses through a certain period, I need to find out the following

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

## Installation

The code in index.js is starting by declaring the variables for the provided array. Followed by looping through the array with adding code and if conditions to find answers to above questions.
